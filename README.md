# IELTS Speaking Master

A React-based application designed to help users practice and improve their IELTS Speaking test skills. This app simulates the three parts of the IELTS Speaking test, records audio responses, and provides AI-powered feedback using Google's Gemini AI.

## Features

- **Full Test Simulation**: Practice all three parts of the IELTS Speaking test.
- **Individual Part Practice**: Focus on Part 1, Part 2, or Part 3 separately.
- **Audio Recording**: Record your spoken responses directly in the app.
- **AI Evaluation**: Receive detailed feedback and scores powered by Google Gemini AI.
- **Timers**: Built-in preparation and speaking time limits to mimic real test conditions.
- **Results Dashboard**: View your performance with charts and detailed analysis.

## Technologies Used

- **React 19**: For building the user interface.
- **Vite**: Fast build tool and development server.
- **TypeScript**: For type-safe JavaScript development.
- **Google Generative AI (@google/genai)**: For AI-powered evaluation of responses.
- **Recharts**: For data visualization in results.
- **Heroicons**: For icons and UI elements.
